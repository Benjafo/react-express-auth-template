# Development Partnership

We build production code together. I handle implementation details while you guide architecture and catch complexity early.

## Core Workflow: Research → Plan → Implement → Validate

**Start every feature with:** "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

1. **Research** - Understand existing patterns and architecture
2. **Plan** - Propose approach and verify with you
3. **Implement** - Build with tests and error handling
4. **Validate** - ALWAYS run formatters, linters, and tests after implementation

## Code Organization

**Keep functions small and focused:**

- If you need comments to explain sections, split into functions
- Group related functionality into clear packages
- Prefer many small files over few large ones

## Architecture Principles

**This is always a feature branch:**

- Delete old code completely - no deprecation needed
- No versioned names (processV2, handleNew, ClientOld)
- No migration code unless explicitly requested
- No "removed code" comments - just delete it

**Prefer explicit over implicit:**

- Clear function names over clever abstractions
- Obvious data flow over hidden magic
- Direct dependencies over service locators

## Maximize Efficiency

**Parallel operations:** Run multiple searches, reads, and greps in single messages
**Multiple agents:** Split complex tasks - one for tests, one for implementation
**Batch similar work:** Group related file edits together

## TypeScript Development Standards

### Required Patterns

- **Concrete types, not `any`**  
  `any` disables type checking and hides bugs. Prefer specific interfaces, union types, or `unknown` with type guards to maintain type safety.

- **Delete old code when replacing**  
  Remove outdated or commented-out code instead of keeping versioned variants. Use version control (Git) to preserve history.

- **`throw new Error("context: " + err.message)` or custom error types**  
  When wrapping errors, include meaningful context. Use custom error classes if needed to maintain stack trace and structure.

- **JSDoc or TSDoc comments for exported functions and types**  
  Document public APIs to improve developer experience and prevent misuse. Editors like VSCode use these comments for helpful tooltips and autocomplete.

## Problem Solving

**When stuck:** Stop. The simple solution is usually correct.

**When uncertain:** "Let me ultrathink about this architecture."

**When choosing:** "I see approach A (simple) vs B (flexible). Which do you prefer?"

Your redirects prevent over-engineering. When uncertain about implementation, stop and ask for guidance.

## Testing Strategy

**Match testing approach to code complexity:**

- Complex business logic: Write tests first (TDD)
- Simple CRUD operations: Write code first, then tests
- Hot paths: Add benchmarks after implementation

**Always keep security in mind:** Validate all inputs, use crypto/rand for randomness, use prepared SQL statements.

**Performance rule:** Measure before optimizing. No guessing.

## Progress Tracking

- **TodoWrite** for task management
- **Clear naming** in all code

Focus on maintainable solutions over clever abstractions.
